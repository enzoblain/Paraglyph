# 📝 Paraglyph

**Paraglyph** is a domain-specific language (DSL) built in **Rust** for the [Paragon](https://github.com/enzoblain/Paragon) platform. It enables developers and traders to **design, test, and automate custom trading logic** using a concise and expressive syntax, with a strong focus on Smart Money Concepts (SMC).

Whether you're modeling liquidity grabs, order blocks, or market structure shifts, **Paraglyph** is purpose-built to express SMC-based strategies intuitively — while remaining flexible enough to support AI integrations, custom risk engines, and other advanced trading mechanisms.
